The MIDFIELD Institute is a hands-on workshop that helps participants explore using the Multiple-Institution Database for Investigating Longitudinal Development (MIDFIELD).  The Institute ia an all-virtual meeting over several days.




## About MIDFIELD 

MIDFIELD is a partnership of higher education institutions with engineering programs. Begun in 2004 as an extension of the SUCCEED Longitudinal Database, MIDFIELD contains student-level records for all undergraduate, degree-seeking students at the partner institutions. 

As of June 2024, MIDFIELD contains student-level records for 2.4&nbsp;M undergraduates at 21 US institutions.
