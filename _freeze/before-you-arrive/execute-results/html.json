Clicking the *Copy to Clipboard* icon ![](figures/clipboard-copy-icon.png) in the top right corner of the code chunk copies the code to your clipboard, saving some typing time. For example:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# sample code chunk\nx <- 10 \n```\n:::\n\n\n\n## Already use R?\n\nIf you are already an R and RStudio integrated development environment (IDE) user, this is a great time to check for updates. \n\n**Updating RStudio**\n\n- RStudio menu *Help \\> Check for Updates* will tell you if you are current or not. \n- To update, close RStudio on your machine, download the new version from [Posit)](https://posit.co/downloads/). \n\n**Update your packages**\n\n[How to upgrade all out-of-date packages](https://rstats.wtf/maintaining-r.html#how-to-upgrade-all-out-of-date-packages) in *What They Forgot to Teach You About R* by Jennifer Bryan and Jim Hester. \n\n\n**Updating R**\n\nThe easiest way to update R is to simply [download the newest version](https://cloud.r-project.org/). RStudio will automatically use the latest you've installed. \n\n\nAlternatively, Windows users can use the installr package:\n\n- Install the installr package \n- If open, close R and RStudio \n- Navigate to your most recent `Rgui.exe` file located in your Programs directory, e.g., `C:\\Program Files\\R\\R-4.3.3\\bin\\x64\\Rgui.exe`  \n- Right-click on `Rgui.exe` and run as administrator\n- In the R GUI window that appears, run the commands\n\n``` r\n    # Windows users only\n    library(\"installr\")\n    updateR()\n```\n\n**Updating your R library**\n\n[How to transfer your library when updating R](https://rstats.wtf/maintaining-r.html#how-to-transfer-your-library-when-updating-r) also by Bryan and Hester. Requires the fs package.  \n\n\n## New to R? \n\nThis section is for anyone who has not yet installed R or RStudio. \n\nThe first steps are to install R and RStudio. Both R and RStudio are free. Windows users may have to login as an Administrator before installing the software. \n\n- [Install R and RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/#download) from the \"Posit\" website. Alternatively, you can download R directly from the [R website](https://cloud.r-project.org).\n\n\nOnce the installation is complete, you can take a 2-minute tour of the RStudio interface.\n\n- [Let's start (00:57--02:32)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfcX5DEMAp4?start=57&end=152) by R Ladies Sydney [@RLadiesSydney:2018:Lesson1]   \n\nThe same video includes a longer (7 minute) tour of the four quadrants (panes) in RStudio if you are interested. \n\n- [The RStudio quadrants (07:21--14:40)](https://www.youtube.com/embed/kfcX5DEMAp4?start=441&end=880) by R Ladies Sydney [@RLadiesSydney:2018:Lesson1] \n\n\n## Start the setup\n\nOnce you have R and RStudio up and running on your system, we have a short set of setup instructions to help prepare you for the workshop R tutorials. \n\nWe start by creating an RStudio *Project* file and directory. You can recognize an R project file by its *.Rproj* suffix. \n\n(Optional) If you prefer your instructions with commentary, \n\n- [Start with a Project (02:34--04:50)](https://www.youtube.com/embed/kfcX5DEMAp4?start=154&end=290){target=\"_blank\"} by R Ladies Sydney [@RLadiesSydney:2018:Lesson1] \n- If you follow the instructions on the video, then when finished, use *File > Close* to close any open projects you created. Then create a new project for the Institute as follows. \n\nCreate an RStudio Project for the MIDFIELD Institute:  \n\n- RStudio, *File &gt; New Project... &gt; New Directory &gt; New Project* \n- Or, click the *New Project* button in the Console ribbon, \n\n![](figures/rstudio-new-project.png){fig-alt=\"rstudio new project button\"}\n\nIn the dialog box that appears, \n  \n- Type the workshop name as the directory name, for example, `midfield-institute-2024`    \n- Use the browse button to select a location on your computer to create the project  folder  \n- Click the *Create Project* button  \n \nYou now have the RStudio Project for the MIDFIELD Institute up and running. If you happen to close the project, simply click on the `midfield-institute-2024.Rproj` file to re-open your work. \n\n\n\n\n::: {.callout-tip appearance=\"default\"}\n*Using RStudio projects.* For more information about RStudio projects in general, see the [RStudio Project support  page](https://support.posit.co/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-RStudio-Projects).  \n::: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Add some folders \n\nIf your Institute Project is still open, the \"Files\" pane should show one item in your project directory. If not, click on the `midfield-institute-2024.Rproj` file to re-open your work.\n\n![](figures/rproj-directory-0.png){width=50%}\n\nAdd three folders to the main project folder. To create folders: \n\n- use your usual method of creating new folders on your machine \n- or you can use the *New Folder* button in the Files pane \n\n![](figures/rproj-directory-4.png){width=50%}\n\n\n\nWe use the folders as follows: \n\n- `data` data files (for data not included in an R package)\n- `scripts` R scripts that operate on data to produce results  \n- `results` publication-ready graphs and tabulated results \n\n\nFor a video guide, \n\n- [Make some folders  (04:50--06:08)](https://www.youtube.com/embed/kfcX5DEMAp4?start=290&end=368){target=\"_blank\"} by R Ladies Sydney [@RLadiesSydney:2018:Lesson1] \n\n\n::: {.callout-tip appearance=\"default\"}\n*Organizing a computational project.* If you are interested in a comprehensive set of \"good enough practices\" for scientific computing, we highly recommend [@Wilson+Bryan+others:2017]. The sections on data management, software, collaboration, and project organization are particularly useful to consider at the beginning of a project. \n:::\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Install CRAN packages\n\nThe fundamental unit of shareable code in R is the *package.* For the R novice, an R package is like an \"app\" for R---a collection of functions, data, and documentation for doing work in R that is easily shared with others  [@wickham2014advanced]. \n\nMost packages are obtained from the [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/){target=\"_blank\"} website [@cranweb]. To install a CRAN package using RStudio:\n\n- Launch RStudio \n\nThe RStudio interface has several panes. We want the *Files/Plots/Packages* pane. \n\n- Select the *Packages*  tab  \n\n![](figures/rstudio-packages.png){fig-alt=\"rstudio packages pane\"}\n\n\nNext, \n\n- Click *Install* on the ribbon \n- In the dialog box, type the name of the package. For our first package, type  `data.table` to install the data.table package [@R-data.table]\n- Check the *Install dependencies* box \n- Click the  *Install* button \n\n\n\n> During the installation, Windows users might get a warning message about \n> Rtools, something like:\n>    \n> `WARNING: Rtools is required to build R packages but is not currently` \n> `installed. Please download etc.` \n\n\nRtools is needed for packages with C/C++/FORTRAN code from source---which does not apply to us. You may ignore the warning and carry on. \n\nIn the RStudio Console, you should see a message like this one,  \n\n``` r\npackage 'data.table' successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked\n```\n\nIf successful, the package will appear in the Packages pane, e.g., \n\n![](figures/rstudio-packages-3.png){fig-alt=\"rstudio packages pane\"}\n\nRepeat the process for the following packages: \n\n    checkmate\n    ggplot2\n    wrapr\n    curl\n\nAlternatively, you can install them all at once by typing in the Console: \n\n``` r\npackages_we_use <- c(\"data.table\", \"ggplot2\", \"checkmate\", \"wrapr\", \"curl\")\ninstall.packages(packages_we_use)\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n## Install midfieldr\n\n\nInstall with:\n\n```r\n# type in the RStudio Console \ninstall.packages(\"midfieldr\")\n```\n\n:::{.callout-tip appearance=\"default\"}\nIf you get an error message like the one below, it means that the packages in the dependencies list have not been installed. \n\n![](figures/error.png)\n\nThe remedy is to install any packages listed in the error message and then install midfieldr again. \n:::\n\nOnce midfieldr is successfully installed, you can confirm the installation by running the following lines to bring up the package help page in the Help window. \n\n``` r\n# type in the RStudio Console \nlibrary(\"midfieldr\")\n?midfieldr\n```\n\nIf the installation is successful, the code chunk above should produce a view of the help page as shown here. \n\n![](figures/README-midfieldr-help-page-2.png){fig-alt=\"midfiedr help page pane\"}\n\n\n## Install midfielddata\n\nBecause of its size, the data package is stored in a `drat` repository instead of CRAN. Installation takes time; please be patient and wait for the Console prompt \">\" to reappear. \n\nType (or copy and paste) the following lines in the RStudio Console. \n\n```r\n# type in the RStudio Console  \ninstall.packages(\"midfielddata\", \n                 repos = \"https://MIDFIELDR.github.io/drat/\", \n                 type = \"source\")\n# be patient\n```\n\nOnce the Console prompt \">\" reappears, you can confirm a successful installation by viewing the package help page. In the Console, run:\n\n```r\n# type in the RStudio Console  \nlibrary(\"midfielddata\")\n?midfielddata\n```\n\nIf the installation is successful, the code chunk above should produce a view of the help page as shown here.  \n\n![](figures/README-midfielddata-help-page-2.png){fig-alt=\"midfiedldata help page pane\"}\n\n\n\n## Finish the setup\n\nAs a final task, save your open files and close RStudio. \n\nIf you get a prompt about saving your workspace image, the answer is No.  \n\nYou can turn this prompt off by reopening RStudio and use the pulldown menu: \n\n- _Tools &gt; Global Options..._\n- In the dialog box, _Save workspace to .RData on exit:_  Select \"Never\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Homework\n\n\nIf you are new to R (or new to the ggplot2 or data.table packages), we recommend you complete the three [pre-workshop tutorials](agenda.html) for an introduction to R including manipulating data and creating charts. \n\nCompleting these tutorials before attending the Institute will make your time with us that much more productive. \n\n",
