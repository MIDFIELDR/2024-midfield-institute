This adaptation and extension, *R chart basics* by Richard Layton, is licensed under [CC BY-SA 2.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/legalcode). \n\n## Preface\n\nThe rationale for using the ggplot2 package instead of other R graphics environments (e.g., lattice, base R, or grid graphics) is nicely summarized by Zumel and Mount---it \"excels at combining multiple graphical elements together\" even though \"its syntax can take some getting used to\" [@Zumel+Mount:2020, 60]. They raise three key points: \n\n- Graphs in ggplot2 are defined only on data frames. The variables from the data frame---assigned to the x-axis, the y-axis, or to the color or size of a data marker---are called *aesthetics*, declared using the `aes()` function. \n- The `ggplot()` function declares the graph object; its arguments can include the data frame of interest and the aesthetics. The `ggplot()` function doesn't itself produce a visualization; visualizations are produced by *layers*.\n- Layers produce the plots and plot transformations and are added to a graph object using the `+` operator. Each layer can also take a data frame and aesthetics as arguments, in addition to layer-specific parameters. Example of layers are `geom_point()` for a scatterplot and `geom_line()` for a line plot. \n\n[Before starting.]{.important} Our tutorials assume that you\n\n- Have completed the [Before you arrive](before-you-arrive.html) instructions\n- Have completed the [R basics](r-basics.html) guide \n- Start your R session by launching the RStudio project you created, e.g., `midfield-institute-2023.Rproj`\n\nIf you are in an RStudio project, the project name appears in the upper left corner of the RStudio window. Your project directory (folder) should look something like this:\n\n    midfield-institute-2023\\\n        data\\\n        results\\\n        scripts\\\n        midfield-institute-2023.Rproj\n\n\n## Getting started \n\n[Start a new script.]{.important} I recommend that you start a new script for this segment. \n\n- Use *File &gt; New File &gt; R Script* to create a new R script\n- *File &gt; Save As...* to name the file (we suggest `02-chart-basics.R`), then save it to the `scripts` directory \n- At the top of the script, add a minimal header, something like: \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# R chart basics\n# your name  \n# date \n```\n:::\n\n\n- Use `library()` to load packages used in the script. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# silently load packages\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages(library(\"ggplot2\"))\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages(library(\"data.table\"))\n\n# set data.table printout options\noptions(\n  datatable.print.nrows = 20,\n  datatable.print.topn = 5,\n  datatable.print.class = TRUE\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\nReminder: In a code chunk like the one above, you can click on the *Copy to Clipboard* icon ![](figures/clipboard-copy-icon.png) in the upper right corner to enable quick copy and paste from this document to your script.\n\nUse your script throughout the tutorial. When a new chunk of code is given,  \n\n- Copy the line(s) of code into your script, save, and run.     \n- Check your result by comparing it to the result in the tutorial.\n- Check what you've learned using the **Your turn** exercises. \n\n## Data\n\n[Introduction.]{.important} R comes with many datasets installed. We'll use the `ChickWeight` data set to cover some basic data manipulation to prepare the data for graphing. \n\nThe help page for `ChickWeight` summarizes the experiment from which the data were collected,  \n\n> The body weights of the chicks were measured at birth and every second day thereafter until day 20. They were also measured on day 21. There were four groups of chicks on different protein diets.” \n\nYou can view the help page by running,  \n\n``` r\nhelp(\"ChickWeight\")\n```\n\nThere are 578 observations (rows) and 4 variables (columns). Recall that names are case-sensitive---`weight` is lowercase, the other variables are capitalized. \n\n- `Chick`: unique ID for each chick.\n- `Diet`: one of four protein diets.\n- `Time`: number of days since birth.\n- `weight`: body weight of chick in grams.\n\nThe goal of graphing the data is to investigate the effect of diet on weight over time.\n\n[Download and save a CSV file.]{.important} We use the data.table `fread()` function to read the data set from the workshop repository (an Internet connection is required). \n\nWe use `fwrite()` to save the file to the `data` directory in your project folder. \n\n```r\n# data URL\ndata_url <- \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MIDFIELDR/2023-midfield-institute/main/data/chick_weight.csv\"\n\n# download the data\nchick_weight <- fread(data_url)\n\n# write the data to your data directory\nfwrite(chick_weight, \"data/chick_weight.csv\")\n```\n\nThese lines of code are run only once. After the data are downloaded, these lines can be commented out, e.g., \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# # data URL\n# data_url <- \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MIDFIELDR/2023-midfield-institute/main/data/chick_weight.csv\"\n# \n# # download the data\n# chick_weight <- fread(data_url)\n# \n# # write the data to your data directory\n# fwrite(chick_weight, \"data/chick_weight.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n[Import a CSV file.]{.important} We import the data from the local file  `chick_weight.csv` using `fread()`. This function returns a data.table object.  A data.table is a data.frame with additional attributes.  \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncw <- fread(\"data/chick_weight.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n[Look at the data.]{.important} To look at the data, type the object (dataset) name:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# view the data\ncw\n#>      Chick  Diet  Time weight\n#>      <int> <int> <int>  <int>\n#>   1:    18     1     0     39\n#>   2:    18     1     2     35\n#>   3:    16     1     0     41\n#>   4:    16     1     2     45\n#>   5:    16     1     4     49\n#>  ---                         \n#> 574:    48     4    14    170\n#> 575:    48     4    16    222\n#> 576:    48     4    18    261\n#> 577:    48     4    20    303\n#> 578:    48     4    21    322\n```\n:::\n\n\nSeveral base R functions help us inspect the data. In addition to `str()` that you used in the previous tutorial, we also have:  \n\n- `summary()` provides a summary\n- `head()` and `tail()` display the beginning and end of the data set\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsummary(cw)\n#>      Chick            Diet            Time           weight     \n#>  Min.   : 1.00   Min.   :1.000   Min.   : 0.00   Min.   : 35.0  \n#>  1st Qu.:13.00   1st Qu.:1.000   1st Qu.: 4.00   1st Qu.: 63.0  \n#>  Median :26.00   Median :2.000   Median :10.00   Median :103.0  \n#>  Mean   :25.75   Mean   :2.235   Mean   :10.72   Mean   :121.8  \n#>  3rd Qu.:38.00   3rd Qu.:3.000   3rd Qu.:16.00   3rd Qu.:163.8  \n#>  Max.   :50.00   Max.   :4.000   Max.   :21.00   Max.   :373.0\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: panel-tabset\n\n## [Exercise 2.1]{.important} \n\nUse `tail()` to examine the last observations in `cw` and compare to the last observations in the `ChickWeight` data set provided in base R. Do they agree? Describe the differences, if any. \n\n## Answer\n\nThe variables (columns) are the same but in different order. The observations (rows) are apparently in different order too. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```\n#>    Chick  Diet  Time weight\n#>    <int> <int> <int>  <int>\n#> 1:    48     4    12    154\n#> 2:    48     4    14    170\n#> 3:    48     4    16    222\n#> 4:    48     4    18    261\n#> 5:    48     4    20    303\n#> 6:    48     4    21    322\n#>     weight Time Chick Diet\n#> 573    155   12    50    4\n#> 574    175   14    50    4\n#> 575    205   16    50    4\n#> 576    234   18    50    4\n#> 577    264   20    50    4\n#> 578    264   21    50    4\n```\n:::\n\n\nAlso, the row numbers in `cw` (a data.table) are different from the row numbers in `ChickWeight`. \n:::\n\n\n::: panel-tabset\n\n## [Exercise 2.2]{.important} \n\nUse `str()` to compare `cw` to the original `ChickWeight` in base R. How are they different?\n\n## Answer\n\n`cw` is a data.frame and a data.table object and the variables are all integers. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```\n#> Classes 'data.table' and 'data.frame':\t578 obs. of  4 variables:\n#>  $ Chick : int  18 18 16 16 16 16 16 16 16 15 ...\n#>  $ Diet  : int  1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...\n#>  $ Time  : int  0 2 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 0 ...\n#>  $ weight: int  39 35 41 45 49 51 57 51 54 41 ...\n#>  - attr(*, \".internal.selfref\")=<externalptr>\n```\n:::\n\n\n`ChickWeight` is a data.frame and a groupedData object (a type of ordered grouping). Two columns are integers but two are factors. We'll discuss factors in due course. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```\n#> Classes 'nfnGroupedData', 'nfGroupedData', 'groupedData' and 'data.frame':\t578 obs. of  4 variables:\n#>  $ weight: num  42 51 59 64 76 93 106 125 149 171 ...\n#>  $ Time  : num  0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 ...\n#>  $ Chick : Ord.factor w/ 50 levels \"18\"<\"16\"<\"15\"<..: 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 ...\n#>  $ Diet  : Factor w/ 4 levels \"1\",\"2\",\"3\",\"4\": 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...\n#>  - attr(*, \"formula\")=Class 'formula'  language weight ~ Time | Chick\n#>   .. ..- attr(*, \".Environment\")=<environment: R_EmptyEnv> \n#>  - attr(*, \"outer\")=Class 'formula'  language ~Diet\n#>   .. ..- attr(*, \".Environment\")=<environment: R_EmptyEnv> \n#>  - attr(*, \"labels\")=List of 2\n#>   ..$ x: chr \"Time\"\n#>   ..$ y: chr \"Body weight\"\n#>  - attr(*, \"units\")=List of 2\n#>   ..$ x: chr \"(days)\"\n#>   ..$ y: chr \"(gm)\"\n```\n:::\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## Scatterplot\n\nOur goal is to examine how weight changes over time conditioned by diet. \n\nDon't worry too much about the details of the ggplot2 syntax. To learn more, try different things even if you get an error message. No harm is done! \n\n[First plot.]{.important} Let’s plot the weight data (y axis) as a function of time (x axis). The first plot is empty because there is no \"geom\" (a geometric layer) to encode the data visually. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = cw, mapping = aes(x = Time, y = weight))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](chart-basics_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNext we add the `geom_point()` layer to encode the data as points in a scatterplot. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = cw, mapping = aes(x = Time, y = weight)) + \n  geom_point()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](chart-basics_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n::: panel-tabset\n\n## [Exercise 2.3]{.important} \n\n- Switch the variables `Time` and `weight` in the code chunk.\n- What do you think of this new plot compared to the original?\n\n## Answer\n\nIn a time series, the visual convention (in Latin/Roman-descended societies) is for time to read from left to right, so this chart is not as intuitive as the earlier chart. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](chart-basics_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\n[Location of `+`.]{.important} The `+` symbol that adds a layer to a ggplot2 object cannot start a new line. Using the code above to illustrate, \n\n\n    # correct\n    ggplot(cw, aes(weight, Time)) + geom_point()\n    \n    # correct\n    ggplot(cw, aes(weight, Time)) + \n      geom_point()\n    \n    # incorrect \n    ggplot(cw, aes(weight, Time)) \n      + geom_point()\n\n\n## Another variable\n\n[Color encodes a third variable.]{.important} The graph does not differentiate between the diets. In the next step, we use color to encode `Diet`, a categorical variable with four levels: diets 1, 2, 3, and 4. One important thing to notice is that all arguments being \"mapped\" must be names of variables in the `cw` data frame. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = cw, mapping = aes(x = Time, y = weight, color = factor(Diet))) +\n  geom_point()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](chart-basics_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIt is difficult to conclude anything from this graph as the points are printed on top of one another (with diet 4 overprinting diet 3 which overprints diet 2, etc.).\n\n\n## Faceted chart\n\n[Factor variables.]{.important} Before we continue, we make an important change to the `cw` dataset by transforming `Diet` and `Time` into *factor* variables. Factors are treated by R as categorical variables instead of continuous variables. It will simplify our coding.\n\nThe `:=` operator (from data.table) alters variables “in-place”, with no explicit assignment (`<-`). We revisit the `:=` operator in the *R data basics* tutorial.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# create factors\ncw[, Diet := factor(Diet)]\ncw[, Time := factor(Time)]\n\n# notice the difference?\nsummary(cw) \n#>      Chick       Diet         Time         weight     \n#>  Min.   : 1.00   1:220   0      : 50   Min.   : 35.0  \n#>  1st Qu.:13.00   2:120   2      : 50   1st Qu.: 63.0  \n#>  Median :26.00   3:120   4      : 49   Median :103.0  \n#>  Mean   :25.75   4:118   6      : 49   Mean   :121.8  \n#>  3rd Qu.:38.00           8      : 49   3rd Qu.:163.8  \n#>  Max.   :50.00           10     : 49   Max.   :373.0  \n#>                          (Other):282\n```\n:::\n\n\n[facet_wrap() function.]{.important} `facet_wrap()` is a ggplot2 function that plots variables in separate facets, or panels. In this case, each facet contains one of the four diets. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# create facets by Diet \nggplot(data = cw, mapping = aes(x = Time, y = weight, color = Diet)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  facet_wrap(vars(Diet)) +\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](chart-basics_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n::: panel-tabset\n\n## [Exercise 2.4]{.important} \n\n- To address \"overprinting\" (where points print over other points in the same position), replace `geom_point()` with `geom_jitter()`. \n- What observations about the data can you make? \n\n## Answer\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](chart-basics_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-17-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n- Jittering allows a much better view of the full data set. \n- Diet 4 has the least variability. \n- Diet 3 seems to have the highest weights. \n- We can't really say anything about the mean effect of each diet. \n:::\n\n::: panel-tabset\n\n## [Exercise 2.5]{.important} \n\nFor the `legend.position` argument, try using “top”, “left” and\n“none”.

The diet types are in the panel headers, so a legend is unnecessary. \n:::\n\n## Mean line chart\n\nNext we plot the *mean* changes over time for each diet using the `stat_summary()` function. Because we do not have facets this time, we use the default legend. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = cw, mapping = aes(x = Time, y = weight, group = Diet, color = Diet)) +\n  stat_summary(fun = \"mean\", geom = \"line\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](chart-basics_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-19-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe see that diet 3 has the highest mean weight gain by the end of the experiment but we don’t have any information about the variation (uncertainty) in the data.\n\n::: panel-tabset\n\n## [Exercise 2.6]{.important} \n\n- What happens when you add `geom_point()` to the plot above?
