Very useful if you are familiar with dplyr syntax and want to translate that familiar functionality to data.table syntax. \n\n- @R-data.table-website for the data.table website with vignettes by the package authors \n\n- @R-ggplot2-gallery for a gallery of chart designs possible with ggplot2.\n\n- [R-bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/), a searchable aggregator of R blogs.\n\n- [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r) Searchable, public platform for coding questions and answers. For R-specific Q&A, add `[r]` as a search tag. Additional search tags such as `[ggplot2]` or `[data.table]` will help narrow your searches involving these packages. \n\n- @R-rstudio-cheatsheets (\"Posit\" is the new name of RStudio.) Links to downloadable help summaries (cheat sheets) for ggplot2 and many other packages. For data.table scroll down to the \"Contributed cheatsheets\" section. \n\n- @Zumel+Mount:2020 for data science work with a very good chapter on data manipulation that performs every step three ways: a base R solution,  a data.table solution, and a dplyr solution. \n\n\n\n\n## Data visualization \n\nBooks \n\n- @Cairo:2019 for a data journalist's approach to avoiding lying to an audience (and to one's self).\n\n- @Cleveland:1993 for a detailed look at matching chart design to the types of variables. \n\n- @Robbins:2013 for a detailed development of principles and practices for creating effective charts, based largely on Cleveland's work. \n\n- @Tufte:1983 One of the best developments of aligning one's visual rhetoric to one's verbal rhetoric.\n\n- @Wainer:1997 Often humorous in presenting do's and dont's of data display\n\n- @Wainer:2014 Using evidence and visualization to improve healthcare.\n\nBlogs\n\n- @Evergreen:blog:2023 Intentional reporting and data visualization\n\n- @Few:blog:2021 Visual business intelligence \n\n- @Knaflic:blog:2023 Storytelling with data\n\n- @Layton:2023 for Richard's blog in which several articles illustrate redesigning a published chart in an engineering education article to better align the logic of a display with the logic of the argument. \n\n\n\n## Data visualization using R\n\n- @Healy:2019 Hands-on introduction to principles and practices of looking at and presenting data using R and ggplot2.\n\n- @Machlis:2019 Especially useful for spreadsheet users who want to \"graduate\" to a reproducible scripted programming language. \n\n## References\n",
