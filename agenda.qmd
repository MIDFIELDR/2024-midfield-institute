## Pre-workshop




**Pre-workshop tutorials**     
If you are new to R (or new to the ggplot2 or data.table packages), we recommend you complete the three introductory tutorials listed below. Completing these tutorials before attending the Institute will make your time with us that much more productive.

- [R basics](r-basics.html)   
- [R chart basics](chart-basics.html)
- [R data basics](data-basics.html)

Each tutorial can be completed in under an hour if you have any experience with procedural programming languages such as MATLAB, R, or Python. Programming novices might need more than an hour each. 






## Tuesday, June 11


[Join the online office hours](https://purdue-edu.zoom.us/j/98641259224?pwd=c3FIU2p0U0FKd1htMHVCcnJZWUJ3dz09)     


**Office hours**    
*1:00--5:00 pm Eastern Time.*  We are available for answering questions and resolving problems you encounter installing R or working with R in the three pre-workshop tutorials.

**Guided practice.**    
*3:00--5:00*    
Self-paced case study using midfieldr and midfielddata. Real-time help.

- [Case study: Goals](https://midfieldr.github.io/midfieldr/articles/art-001-case-goals.html) A short reading.   
- [Case study: Data](https://midfieldr.github.io/midfieldr/articles/art-002-case-data.html) A midfieldr tutorial. 



**Wrap-up**    
*before 5:00*    
Please check in with us before leaving the virtual meeting.



**Homework**

- Complete the guided practice "Data" tutorial. 
- For our think-share activities in tomorrow's data visualization session, consider printing a hard-copy of the worksheet. (Download link in tomorrow's program below.)

[Optional resources]{.important} 

- Topics from today's guided practice are developed in greater detail in midfieldr package vignettes  [[link]](https://midfieldr.github.io/midfieldr/articles/).





## Thursday, June 13

[Join the online meeting](https://purdue-edu.zoom.us/j/98641259224?pwd=c3FIU2p0U0FKd1htMHVCcnJZWUJ3dz09) 

**Metaphors and metrics**  
*1:00--1:30 Eastern Time*  
Pipelines, pathways, and ecosystems.  

 

**Break**    
*1:30--1:40*  

**Guided practice**  
*1:40--2:30*  
[Case study: Results](https://midfieldr.github.io/midfieldr/articles/art-003-case-results.html) Continue the case study.  

**Data visualization session 1** [![](resources/download-icon.png) worksheets](resources/2024-effective-charts-handout.pdf)  [![](resources/download-icon.png) slides](resources/effective-charts-slides.pdf)    
*2:30--3:20*  
A hard-copy printout of the worksheet is recommended for our think-share activities. We demonstrate the perceptual limitations of common graph types and suggest more effective alternatives. Our goals in visual rhetoric are  
  
- Improving **perception** of stories in the data
- Facilitating quantitative **reasoning** about the data
- Enhancing **credibility** of evidence supporting an argument
 
 **Break**    
*3:20--3:30* 

**A practice research question**  
*3:30--5:00*  

We partially define a practice research question to be examined using midfieldr and midfielddata. Working in small groups and given a specific metric, choose programs and student blocs and develop the appropriate  data and chart(s) to explore possible stories in your data. Report out your progress by the end of the day.

Please check in with us before leaving the virtual meeting.

**Homework**

- Complete the guided practice "Results" tutorial. 
- Consider what research question you would like to work on during the final day of the workshop. You may continue the practice question you started today or you may develop a new research question.
