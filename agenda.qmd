## Thursday, July 13

[Join the online meeting](https://purdue-edu.zoom.us/j/99534954101?pwd=QkZ3SlpDZyszVVZDQkU4ZWR5TjMwdz09)    




**Metaphors and metrics** [![](resources/download-icon.png) slides](resources/2023-metaphors-and-metrics-slides.pdf)   
*1:00--1:30 Eastern Time*    
Pipelines, pathways, and ecosystems. 

[Supplement.]{.important} [![](resources/download-icon.png) slides  ](resources/Finding-the-migration-yield-metric.pdf). Finding the migration yield metric. A supplemental reference that outlines our iterative process of develop an argument that concludes with a new metric (migration yield) and its chart. Illustrates the iterative interplay between one's visual rhetoric and one's verbal rhetoric.  




**Break**    
1:30--1:40  




**Guided practice**    
*1:40--2:30*    
[Case study: Results](https://midfieldr.github.io/midfieldr/articles/art-003-case-results.html) Continue the case study. 




**Data visualization session 1** [![](resources/download-icon.png) slides](resources/effective-charts-slides.pdf) [![](resources/download-icon.png) worksheets](resources/2023-effective-charts-handout.pdf)    
*2:30--3:20*    
A hard-copy printout of the worksheet is recommended for our think-share activities. We demonstrate the perceptual limitations of common graph types and suggest more effective alternatives. Our goals in visual rhetoric are  
  
- Improving **perception** of stories in the data
- Facilitating quantitative **reasoning** about the data
- Enhancing **credibility** of evidence supporting an argument
 
 
 
 
 **Break**    
3:20--3:30
