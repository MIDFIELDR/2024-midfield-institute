```{r}
#| label: setup
#| include: false
knitr::opts_chunk$set(comment = "#>",

Using **base R**, **data.table**, and **dplyr/tidyr** to transform MIDFIELD data as needed for your analysis. 

In this series of articles, we hope to address the needs of users who would prefer to use base R or dplyr syntax in lieu of the data.table syntax that appears everywhere else in midfieldr tutorials. We illustrate common data shaping tasks three ways: using base R, data.table, and dplyr systems. 

Sources for translating among the three systems include [@Atrebas:2019; @Gimond:2019; @Hajnala:2018; @Mercer:2020; and @Vaughan:2023]. In particular, our outline is roughly based on Chapter 5 of [@Zumel+Mount:2020]. 





## Getting started

[Project organization.]{.important} If you are writing your own scripts to follow along, our tutorials assume that you:

- Are working within an [RStudio Project](before-you-arrive.html#start-the-setup)
- Have set up a directory structure with folders for [data and scripts](before-you-arrive.html#add-some-folders).

<br> 

[Packages.]{.important} The table lists the packages used in the data shaping articles overall. You may wish to [install](before-you-arrive.html#install-cran-packages) these packages before starting. 

```{r}
#| echo: false
wrapr::build_frame(
    "packages"    , "used for" |
    "midfielddata", "student records practice data" |
    "data.table"  , "manipulating data" |
    "dplyr"       , "manipulating data" |
    "tidyr"       , "manipulating data" |
    "readr"       , "import data" |
    "wrapr"       , "tools for writing and debugging R code"|
    "cdata"       , "reshaping transforms"|
    "ggplot2"     , "creating charts"
) |>
  gt() |>
  tab_caption("Table 1: Packages in the data shaping articles") |>
  tab_options(table.font.size = "small") |>
  opt_stylize(style = 1, color = "gray")
```

<br>

We load the packages used in an article as one of the first code chunks, as shown below. You can copy any code chunk by clicking on the "Copy to clipboard" icon ![](figures/clipboard-icon.png).

```{r}
# packages used in this article
library("midfielddata")
library("data.table")
library("dplyr", warn.conflicts = FALSE)
library("readr")
library("wrapr")
```





## Data 

*Load* the datasets from midfielddata. View data dictionaries via `?student`, `?term`, and `?degree`. 

```{r}
data(student, term, degree)
```

Have a quick look at each one using dplyr `glimpse()`. 

```{r}
glimpse(student)

glimpse(term)

glimpse(degree)
```





## Three systems

For every data frame we use, we construct a separate version for each system. For example, the three versions of the `student` table are prepared as shown below. Code chunks are color-coded by system. 

```{r}
#| class: base
# base R
student_df <- data.frame(student)
```

```{r}
#| class: dtbl
# data.table
student_dt <- copy(student)
```

```{r}
#| class: dplyr
# dplyr
student_tbl <- tibble(student)
```

<br> 

The data frame names include a suffix to indicate the system as well. 

```{r}
#| echo: false
wrapr::build_frame(
  "system"    , "suffix", "example"    , "class" |
  "base R"    , "_df"   , "student_df" , "data.frame" |
  "data.table", "_dt"   , "student_dt" , "data.frame, data.table" |
  "dplyr"     , "_tbl"  , "student_tbl", "data.frame, tbl_df, tbl"
) |>
  gt() |>
  tab_caption("Table 2: Dataset naming convention") |>
  tab_options(table.font.size = "small") |>
  opt_stylize(style = 1, color = "gray")
```





## Method

1. We want to make each operation as transparent as possible for the R novice. Hence we generally write a line of code to do one thing, avoiding combined or nested operations and introducing intermediate or temporary variables that get overwritten before reaching a desired result, e.g., `DF` for an intermediate data.frame, `DT` for an intermediate data.table, `vec` for an intermediate vector, etc.  

2. In the same vein, we sometimes use intermediate variables for indexing, e.g. `rows_we_want`, `columns_we_want`, `order_index`, etc. 

3. In general, we show only one approach per task per system, offering what we think is the best choice for our audience. In R there are usually multiple approaches for the same task and resources for exploring other methods are readily available. 

4. We follow the convention of chaining dplyr steps with the magrittr pipe `%>%` (though assigning temporary variables would work just as well). We do not generally use the piping or chaining operations available in base R and data.table.  

5. In each example, results are manipulated such that base R, data.table, and dplyr yield the same form (usually a data frame) with the same variables and observations. In most cases, we compare data frame equivalence with  `wrapr::check_equiv_frames()` which converts its arguments to data.frame class and reorders columns and rows. 

```{r}
check_equiv_frames(student_df, student_dt)
check_equiv_frames(student_dt, student_tbl)
```

6. In cases where re-ordering rows or columns is part of the task, we compare results by using base R `all.equal()` instead of `check_equiv_frames()`. By setting the `check.attributes` argument to FALSE, data frame attributes (other than column names) are ignored, for example, row.names (if any) and class (e.g., `tbl` or `data.table`).

```{r}
all.equal(student_df, student_dt, check.attributes = FALSE)
all.equal(student_dt, student_tbl, check.attributes = FALSE)
```








## Download and write CSV files

In addition to the student record data in the midfielddata package, we have some prepared data to download from the Institute repository (an Internet connection is required). 

*Download and write* a CSV file to your RStudio project data directory. 

```{r}
# run me first
data_url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MIDFIELDR/2024-midfield-institute/main/data/three_blocs.csv"
```

One of these code chunks can be copied and run in your Console window as these lines only have to be run once. 

```{r}
#| class: base
#| eval: false
# base R
start_ever_grad <- read.csv(data_url)
write.csv(start_ever_grad, "data/start_ever_grad.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```

```{r}
#| class: dtbl
# data.table
start_ever_grad <- fread(data_url)
fwrite(start_ever_grad, "data/start_ever_grad.csv")
```

```{r}
#| class: dplyr
#| eval: false
# readr
start_ever_grad <- read_csv(data_url, show_col_types = FALSE)
write_csv(start_ever_grad, "data/start_ever_grad.csv")
```






## Read CSV files

*Import* the file you just saved. 

```{r}
#| class: base
# base R
start_ever_grad_df <- read.csv("data/start_ever_grad.csv")
```

```{r}
#| class: dtbl
# data.table
start_ever_grad_dt <- fread("data/start_ever_grad.csv")
```

```{r}
#| class: dplyr
# readr
start_ever_grad_tbl <- read_csv("data/start_ever_grad.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)
```

```{r}
start_ever_grad_dt

check_equiv_frames(start_ever_grad_df, start_ever_grad_dt)
check_equiv_frames(start_ever_grad_dt, start_ever_grad_tbl)
```
